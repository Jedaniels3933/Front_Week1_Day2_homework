        <h2>Overlord Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Isekai is a Japanese genre of fantasy that involves a main character being transported to a new world, either physically, mentally, or through reincarnation. The word "isekai" literally translates to "different world" in Japanese. The character may have to survive in the unfamiliar setting, find their way home, or live a regular life.  What makes this story great is that the main character is over powered in this world and uses that advantage to eventually rule over the human population ruthlessly.  Even though the main character Ainz Oaal Gown is basically an evil monster that slaughters humans with no hesitation, the author makes you love the guy because he is so nerdy, awkward and relatable.    </p>
